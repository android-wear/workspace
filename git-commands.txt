To check in:
0. git checkout master
1. git add *.java
2. git commit -m 'my first checkin'
3. git push origin

To sync with origin:
1. git pull
(or "git pull origin master", which pulls from origin to master)

To create new local repository
1. git branch testing
2. git checkout testing

To resolve conflicts:
manually edit... Don't rely on git mergetool as it can open a random text editor.

To check for file changes:
git status

Get checkin history:
git log

Get last 3 checkins:
git log HEAD~3..HEAD

# show the diff for each patch 
git log -p HEAD..origin/master  

# show a single diff 
git diff HEAD...origin/master


# disregard all local changes, force to remote
git reset --hard
